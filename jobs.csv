We provide a quick and easy retirement planning and saving experience, powered by an award-winning digital retirement platform. Common Wealth has earned awards for innovation and plan design from the international wealth management publication, Pensions & Investments, and for pension leadership from Canadian Investment Review magazine. As we continue to fulfill our mission and change the lives of Canadians, we continue to grow. We are currently looking for an Intermediate Front-End Developer (React) to join our team and make a significant contribution to our platform and the future of retirement in Canada. You will be reporting to our Engineering Manager and work closely with our Design and Product teams. Read more about our product and accomplishments here.What you will do: Collaborate with our product team to create new features for the application; one of the ways in which we’re changing the retirement landscape is by delivering a first-class user experience that is mobile-optimized and focused on accessibility. As a front-end developer, you will participate in story development and refinement to help define what features we will introduce into our product. You will help figure out what approach our development team needs to take and what tools to use to build it.Write and deliver code while understanding customer and business needs; once features are defined by the product team, our development team works to break it down into smaller pieces of work. As an intermediate developer, your work will be assigned from there. You will take requirements into consideration and understand the reasoning behind a particular requirement and challenge the approach if you feel there are better alternatives. You will also coordinate with our back-end team to ensure that what you’re building fits into the overall development landscape.Work on testing and automation for what you’ve created; we don’t have a separate testing team in our engineering department, which means each developer on the team is responsible for writing and automating tests for what they’ve created.

You will focus on the highest-quality implementations, recognizing the importance of our product in people’s financial lives.Who you are: Curious, self-directed learner who thrives on ambiguity; from a technical perspective you can be rather junior in your skillset but your mindset needs to resemble a senior developer. What this means to us is that you’re excited by the challenge of getting a story from a product designer and you’re able to jump in and start implementing it and identify any questions you might have. You don’t need precise work requirements but can figure things out, and make the right judgement calls. You know when to ask for help and don’t mind doing so. Your initiative and eagerness to learn makes you a valuable team member.Open-minded and willing to seek out feedback; you enjoy being part of a highly collaborative team that provides a lot of internal feedback. You never feel defensive when other people look at your work and provide opinions or ask questions. You’re open to different ways of doing things and willing to let go of a path you were on if the team feels there’s a better way.Collaborative team member; you understand that great products are built through working with many different stakeholders. You are able to build strong relationships with other mission driven team members, including those outside of the engineering group. You enjoy working with our product team and hearing from our customers about how your work impacts them and our product.Someone who has worked with React in a business environment; you don’t need to be a React expert, but some experience working with it or can demonstrate an active desire to learn. Our tech stack involves Typescript, HTML/CSS and SASS for CSS processing, any experience working with the listed technologies, plus some exposure to automated testing is a bonus.Why Work with us: Working at Common Wealth provides you the opportunity to work in a well-funded start-up that is changing the lives of Canadians. Joining our team of mission-driven developers means you have an incredible amount of autonomy over your day to day work, and can help to disrupt the Canadian retirement landscape. In addition to a competitive salary (80-100k$), health and dental benefits, an additional Health Spending Account, a 5% RRSP matching program and 4 weeks of vacation, Common Wealth also offers a stock-option plan.

We provide a quick and easy retirement planning and saving experience, powered by an award-winning digital retirement platform. Common Wealth has earned awards for innovation and plan design from the international wealth management publication, Pensions & Investments, and for pension leadership from Canadian Investment Review magazine. As we continue to fulfill our mission and change the lives of Canadians, we continue to grow. We are currently looking for an Intermediate Front-End Developer (React) to join our team and make a significant contribution to our platform and the future of retirement in Canada. You will be reporting to our Engineering Manager and work closely with our Design and Product teams. Read more about our product and accomplishments here.What you will do: Collaborate with our product team to create new features for the application; one of the ways in which we’re changing the retirement landscape is by delivering a first-class user experience that is mobile-optimized and focused on accessibility. As a front-end developer, you will participate in story development and refinement to help define what features we will introduce into our product. You will help figure out what approach our development team needs to take and what tools to use to build it.Write and deliver code while understanding customer and business needs; once features are defined by the product team, our development team works to break it down into smaller pieces of work. As an intermediate developer, your work will be assigned from there. You will take requirements into consideration and understand the reasoning behind a particular requirement and challenge the approach if you feel there are better alternatives. You will also coordinate with our back-end team to ensure that what you’re building fits into the overall development landscape.Work on testing and automation for what you’ve created; we don’t have a separate testing team in our engineering department, which means each developer on the team is responsible for writing and automating tests for what they’ve created. In addition to writing/automating these tests, you will also work with more senior developers to get feedback on your work. You will focus on the highest-quality implementations, recognizing the importance of our product in people’s financial lives.Who you are: Curious, self-directed learner who thrives on ambiguity; from a technical perspective you can be rather junior in your skillset but your mindset needs to resemble a senior developer. What this means to us is that you’re excited by the challenge of getting a story from a product designer and you’re able to jump in and start implementing it and identify any questions you might have. You don’t need precise work requirements but can figure things out, and make the right judgement calls. You know when to ask for help and don’t mind doing so. Your initiative and eagerness to learn makes you a valuable team member.Open-minded and willing to seek out feedback; you enjoy being part of a highly collaborative team that provides a lot of internal feedback. You never feel defensive when other people look at your work and provide opinions or ask questions. You’re open to different ways of doing things and willing to let go of a path you were on if the team feels there’s a better way.Collaborative team member; you understand that great products are built through working with many different stakeholders. You are able to build strong relationships with other mission driven team members, including those outside of the engineering group. You enjoy working with our product team and hearing from our customers about how your work impacts them and our product.Someone who has worked with React in a business environment; you don’t need to be a React expert, but some experience working with it or can demonstrate an active desire to learn. Our tech stack involves Typescript, HTML/CSS and SASS for CSS processing, any experience working with the listed technologies, plus some exposure to automated testing is a bonus.Why Work with us: Working at Common Wealth provides you the opportunity to work in a well-funded start-up that is changing the lives of Canadians. Joining our team of mission-driven developers means you have an incredible amount of autonomy over your day to day work, and can help to disrupt the Canadian retirement landscape. In addition to a competitive salary (80-100k$), health and dental benefits, an additional Health Spending Account, a 5% RRSP matching program and 4 weeks of vacation, Common Wealth also offers a stock-option plan. Our team is currently working remotely and we plan to continue that practice into the future. We have an office in downtown Toronto for those that prefer to work from the office. Our growing team combines deep expertise in the key disciplines necessary to help our customers achieve retirement success. We have also formed partnerships with world-class investment and annuities providers, including BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, and Brookfield Annuity, a leading provider of group annuities.

You will receive regular 1:1’s, and bi-annual performance reviews where managers actively help you build learning and development plans.To Apply: We are a respectful workplace committed to building a skilled and diverse workforce.
